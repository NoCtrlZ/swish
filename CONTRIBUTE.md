# Note
## Test
- Unit test should be written in each module file.
- Integration test should be written in `src/lib.rs`.
## Todo
- Capacitate user to set contents length limitation.
- Support almost status code.
- Write unit test and integration test separately.
## Bugs
- Can't handle root routing.
## Point
- If it's necessary to import other module for test, it should be written as integration test.
