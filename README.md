# Swish
This is the fast and light web flamework made by Rust.
## Abstract
There are three rule I have when making this web flamework.
- Don't depend nightly module
- Don't have extra module
- Don't be heavy
```
Sometime other web flamework can't be built because it has dependencies with nightly module. We have to be an OSS committer. WTF. And we don't prefer to use left-pad package. I'd like to say we are just programmer not OSS committer nor fucking copy paster!
