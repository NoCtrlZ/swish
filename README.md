# Swish
![Rust Cargo Test](https://github.com/NoCtrlZ/swish/workflows/Rust%20Cargo%20Test/badge.svg?branch=master)  
This is the beef web flamework for R**ket🥩 Swish Swish Bish🎶 Another one in the basket🏀
## Abstract
### Three rules🔔
There are three rules I have when making this web flamework.
- Don't depend nightly module
- Don't have extra module
- Don't be heavy
### What I want to say🏴‍☠️
Sometime other web flamework can't be built because it has `dependencies with nightly modules`. Do we have to be an OSS committer? WTF. And we don't prefer to use left-pad package. I'd like to say `we are just programmer not OSS committer nor fucking copy paster!`
