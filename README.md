# Swish

This is the beef web flamework for R**ket🥩 Swish Swish Bish🎶 Another One In The Basket🏀
## Abstract
### Three rules🔔
There are three rules I have when making this web flamework.
- Don't depend nightly module
- Don't have extra module
- Don't be heavy
### What I want to say🏴‍☠️
Sometime other Rust web flameworks can't be built because it has `dependencies with nightly modules`. Do we need to be an OSS committer? It's so ridiculous! And we also don't prefer to use left-pad packages. I'd like to say `We are programmer not OSS committer nor fucking copy paster!`
