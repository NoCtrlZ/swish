This Is The Beef Web Flamework For R**ketü•© Swish Swish Bishüé∂ Another One In The BasketüèÄ
```rust
extern crate swish_swish;

use swish_swish::*;

fn swish_swish() -> Swish {
    let mut swish = Swish::new();
    swish.get("/path", path_handler);
    swish.get("/user/:id", user_id_handler);
    swish.post("/user/register", user_register_handler);
    swish
}

fn main() {
    swish_swish().bish();
}
```
## Abstract
### Three rulesüîî
There are three rules I have when making this web flamework.
- Don't depend nightly module
- Don't have extra module
- Don't be heavy
### What I want to sayüè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
Sometime other Rust web flameworks can't be built when it's compiled for production because of `dependencies with nightly modules`. Do we need to be an OSS committer? And we also don't prefer to use left-pad packages. An old coupon expired! I'd like to say `We are programmer not OSS committer nor fucking copy paster!`
## Dependencies Except Std
I count the crime I committed. Karma‚Äòs not a liar!
- regex
- serde
- serde_json
