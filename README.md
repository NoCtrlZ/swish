# Swish
This is the fast and light web flamework made by Rust.
## Abstract
### Three rules
There are three rules I have when making this web flamework.
- Don't depend nightly module
- Don't have extra module
- Don't be heavy
### What I want to say
Sometime other web flamework can't be built because it has `dependencies with nightly modules`. Do we have to be an OSS committer? WTF. And we don't prefer to use left-pad package. I'd like to say `we are just programmer not OSS committer nor fucking copy paster!`
